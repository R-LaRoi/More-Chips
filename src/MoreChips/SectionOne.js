          “There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is
          translated through you into action, and because there is only one of
          you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it
          will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The
          world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good
          it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It
          is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the
          channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your
          work. You have to keep yourself open and aware to the urges that
          motivate you. Keep the channel open. ... No artist is pleased. [There
          is] no satisfaction whatever at any time. There is only a queer divine
          dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us
          more alive than the others”― Martha Graham
